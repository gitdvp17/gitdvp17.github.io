ChatGPT said:
Your Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD pipeline is failing due to a Bundler version mismatch error during the bundle install step.

üîç Root Cause
Your Gemfile.lock expects Bundler 2.6.9, but the system initially runs Bundler 2.4.22, then attempts to install 2.6.9, but the installation and activation fails due to:

undefined method `request' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
This is an internal bug in RubyGems or Bundler when attempting to switch versions mid-process in some environments (especially on Azure‚Äôs Oryx build system).

‚úÖ Fix Options
Option 1: Lock Bundler to the installed version
Update your Gemfile.lock to use the currently working version (2.4.22):

Run this locally in your Jekyll repo:

gem install bundler -v 2.4.22
bundle _2.4.22_ install
Commit the updated Gemfile.lock to your GitHub repo.

Option 2: Pin bundler version in the build
Edit your azure-static-web-apps-*.yml GitHub Actions workflow to use Bundler 2.4.22 explicitly.

Add this step before bundle install:

- name: Install specific Bundler version
  run: gem install bundler -v 2.4.22
And modify your bundle install step like this:

- name: Bundle install
  run: bundle _2.4.22_ install
Option 3: Update your Bundler version locally
If you prefer using Bundler 2.6.9, you‚Äôll need to:

Run this locally:

gem install bundler -v 2.6.9
bundle _2.6.9_ install
Ensure that your Gemfile.lock reflects BUNDLED WITH 2.6.9.

Add this to your workflow:

- name: Install Bundler 2.6.9
  run: gem install bundler -v 2.6.9
- name: Bundle install
  run: bundle _2.6.9_ install
üßº Bonus Tip
Make sure your .github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-*.yml has no conflicting Ruby setup steps.

Would you like me to edit your workflow file with the recommended fix? If yes, let me know which option you prefer.

Great! Since you're seeing the error due to a Bundler version mismatch, I recommend going with Option 2 (pin to bundler 2.4.22), which is the most stable fix with Azure Static Web Apps and Oryx.

Here‚Äôs how your updated GitHub Actions workflow file (likely named something like azure-static-web-apps-*.yml) should look:

‚úÖ Updated azure-static-web-apps-*.yml
name: Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # or your default branch
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build_and_deploy_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build and Deploy Job
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 2.7

      - name: Install Bundler 2.4.22
        run: gem install bundler -v 2.4.22

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bundle _2.4.22_ install

      - name: Build Jekyll site
        run: bundle exec jekyll build

      - name: Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps
        uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
          repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Used for GitHub integrations (i.e., PR comments)
          action: "upload"
          #### Update the following paths to match your repo:
          app_location: "/"       # Root of your Jekyll app
          output_location: "_site" # Built site output
‚úÖ Follow-Up Steps:
Update your Gemfile.lock locally:
In your terminal, run:

gem install bundler -v 2.4.22
bundle _2.4.22_ install
git add Gemfile.lock
git commit -m "Lock bundler to 2.4.22 for Azure compatibility"
git push
Push the updated workflow file:
Replace the content of your .github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-*.yml file with the code above, commit, and push.

Once this is done, GitHub Actions should run again ‚Äî this time successfully building and deploying your Jekyll site via Azure Static Web Apps.

Let me know if you'd like me to review your Gemfile.lock or help debug the next step.
